form page allows the admin to set up a whole account including the password.

(stretch goal) = send email to user once their account is set up

the user should be able to reset their own password without the admin interaction through a seperate page.

things on form:

email: required
password : required
username : optional
first name: required
last name: required
department: (needs implemented) - optional?
